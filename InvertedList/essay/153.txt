 They say the best things in life are free.   A Reddit user asked people from around the world what life's most simple pleasures were, one of which was getting in your own bed after a long journey.   Unsurprisingly, many pleasures that came out top on the list were ones that resulted in a sense of physical relief after solving annoyances or irritations.   These included extracting a popcorn kernel lodged in the teeth, back and head scratches, and also the satisfying first sip of a drink when thirsty.   Reddit users also agreed that freshly baked bread was another simple pleasure in life that made them happy.   A shower with good water pressure was another comfortable life pleasure that Reddit users praised.   1.
