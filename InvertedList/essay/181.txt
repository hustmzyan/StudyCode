 I was sitting on the beach the other day watching a kite (In the shape of a two winged aircraft) flying high in the sky. It made wonderful acrobatic maneuvers as if piloted by a person with a lifetimes experience of flying. However, we all know a kite cannot fly without the power of the wind. So how real was the performance I was watching?   Firstly, it took a person with great imagination to design a kite shaped like a tiger moth aircraft that can encompass the aerodynamics to be powered by the wind. That accomplishment in itself takes great skill and awareness of the forces of nature.   Secondly, the person who purchased the kite needs to read the instructions and learn how to apply the winds forces to achieve a great display. The mind and hand coordination requires a mastery to attain the required skills.   Thirdly, without the power of the wind, the kite would just be a charming, colorful, textured replica of a Tiger Moth aircraft. We cannot see the wind....but we know it must exist, for we can feel it and see the consequences of its power.   So, we have a relationship between the designer and manufacturer which ultimately will connect to the user. It then needs a power of nature that cannot be seen in order to allow the kite to operate. The display I was observing had a lot of behind the scenes work that needed to be performed, before the show could go on.
