  They shuddered with cold, and ran down the road to the bridge. There, warm, they started walking hand in hand.     A flush came into the sky. The waned moon, halfway down the west, sank into insignificance. On the shadowy land, things began to take life, and plants with great leaves became clear. They came to the beach. The long wastes of shore lay moaning under the dawn and the sea; the ocean was a flat dark strip with a white edge. Over the gloomy sea the sky was red. Quickly the fire spread among the clouds and scattered them. Crimson burned to orange, orange to dull gold, and in the golden glitter the sun rose. The sea became glistening, as if someone had gone along with a bucket and the light had spilled from it as she walked.     The breakers ran down the shore in long, hoarse strokes. Tiny seagulls, like little spray, wheeled above the line of surf. Their crying seemed larger than their bodies. Far away the coast reached, melt into the morning. The tussocky sand hills seemed to sink to a level with the beach. On this shore only they watched the sea and the rising sun, and heard the faint water and the sharp crying of the gulls.     他们冷得发抖，于是，他们俩沿着公路跑向小桥。他们暖和多了，手拉手向前走着。     天空中出现了一缕红光。挂在西边天空的一轮弯月慢慢西沉。朦胧的大地上，万物开始苏醒，长满大叶子的植物也清晰可见。他们来到了海滩。漫长的，空无一人的海滩在黎明时分的海边呻吟着；大海就像一条带着白边的扁平的黑带。苍茫大海上的天空泛着红光。不一会儿火红的光芒映红了云彩，将它们一片片散开。颜色渐渐地从深红色变成桔红色，从桔红色变成暗淡的金黄色，于是太阳就在一片金光中升起。海面上顿时波光粼粼，闪耀着金光，好像有人路过，一边走，一边从桶里洒下金光。     激浪拍打着海岸，发出长长的，低浑的轰响。娇小的海鸥，如朵朵小浪花，随着海浪盘旋。它们的叫声不像是从这般娇小的身体里发出的。远处的海岸向前伸展着和晨光交融在一起。草丛丛生的沙丘似乎和海滩连成一线。平坦的海滩上只有他们俩在观看着大海和初升的太阳，倾听着海浪轻微的声响和海鸥尖声的鸣叫。
