  I woke up early today, excited over all I get to do before the clock strikes midnight. I have responsibilities to fulfill today. I am important.     My job is to choose what kind of day I am going to have.     Today I can complain because the weather is rainy or I can be thankful that the grass is getting watered for free.     Today I can fell sad that I don't have more money or I can be glad that my finances encourage me to plan my purchases wisely and guide me away from waste.     Today I can grumble about my health or I can rejoice that I am alive.     Today I can lament over all that my parents didn't give me when I was growing up or I can feel grateful that they allowed me to be born.     Today I can cry because roses have thorns or I can celebrate that thorns have roses.     Today I can mourn my lack of friends or I can excitedly embark upon a quest to discover new relationships.     Today I can murmur dejectedly because I have to do housework or I can feel honored because the Lord has provided shelter for my mind, body and soul.     Today stretches ahead of me, waiting to be shaped. And here I am, the sculptor who gets to do the shaping.     What today will be like is up to me. I get to choose what kind of day I will have!
