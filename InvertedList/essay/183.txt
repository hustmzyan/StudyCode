 I am writing this the day before I know my fate-the day before I know the answer to what will happen in my life. I am writing this with my mind set that I will carry on and not let life pass me by.   I am determined that I will see the world in every aspect that may be possible for me. I am sure that I will become something, even if the envelope that carries my life inside it gives me bad news.   I will not listen to those who insist that a university degree is the only way you will find a means of living these days.   I will ignore those who tell me that I am a dreamer without a dream.   I will tell myself that although I may not be accepted to college, I've seen the northern lights curtain themselves in front of me.   I have tasted the wine in Paris and swum in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.   I have been to an Irish pub, and I have watched the sun rise from the Roman Forum.   I have climbed the Swiss Alps and counted the stars in the sky until I could see no more .   I have experienced what it is like to live, and I will tell myself that even if that envelope is small and exudes rejection, the person that they have rejected will carry on and go on to see more mountains and swim in more waters and keep on counting the stars, because somewhere it is written that I must continue to live my life the way I knows how to.
