  1. People with type O blood tend to attract more mosquitoes than people with other blood types.     2. Malaria carrying mosquitoes were attracted to pregnant women twice as much as non-pregnant women in a study. In light of Zika's link to birth defects, this finding is particularly concerning.     3. In a small study, researchers found mosquitoes liked people who had drank a beer more than their sober counterparts.     4. Some people's bodies emit attractant compounds, while others emit repellent compounds. It's unclear why or how this works, though researchers have tried to isolate the chemicals to use them for mosquito traps or natural bug spray.     5. People with a wider variety of bacteria living on their skin were less attractive to mosquitoes in a study.     6. Mosquitoes tend to like people who emit more carbon dioxide when they breathe, which includes larger people and pregnant women.     7. Working out can produce lactic acid, which can act as an attractant for mosquitoes when it's released in your sweat.
