 Today before you think of saying an unkind word,    Think of someone who can't speak.    Before you complain about the taste of your food,    Think of someone who has nothing to eat.    Before you complain about your husband or wife,    Think of someone who's crying out to God for a companion.    Today before you complain about life,    Think of someone who went too early to heaven.    Before you complain about your children,    Think of someone who desires children but they're barren.    Before you argue about your dirty house someone didn't clean or sweep,    Think of the people who are living in the streets.    Before whining about the distance you drive,    Think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet.    And when you are tired and complain about your job,    Think of the unemployed, the disabled and those who wished they had your job.    But before you think of pointing your finger or condemning another,    Remember that not one of us is without sin and we all answer to one maker.    And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down,    Put a smile on your face and thank God you're alive and still around.    Life is a gift,    Enjoy it,    Celebrate it,    And fulfill it...    And while you want to give love to someone today,    Love someone with what you do and the words you say，    Love is not meant to be kept locked inside of us and hidden,    So give it away" Give love to someone today!"
