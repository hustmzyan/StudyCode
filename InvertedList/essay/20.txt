  You talk when you stop being at peace with your thoughts. When you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart, you will talk, and the sound becomes a pastime. And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered. Thought is like a bird, and once in a cage of words it can unfold its wings, but not fly.     There are people who talk ceaselessly for fear of being alone. And there are those who talk, and unknowingly show a truth about themselves which they themselves do not understand. And there are those who have the truth within them, and know it, and for that very reason don't try to put it into words.     When you meet a friend on the road or in a market, let your spirit move your lips and direct your tongue. Let the voice within your mind speak to the ear of him. His soul will keep the truth of your heart, just as the taste of the wine is remembered when its colour is forgotten.     当你不在思考的时候或者内心不再感到孤独时，你便开始说话，这时候，声音就变成了一种消遣。在你说话的大部分时间里，思想处于被半扼杀的状态下。思想如同小鸟儿，一旦被关进笼子里，或许能展开翅膀，但再也不能飞翔。     有人因害怕孤独而不停地说话。有些人夸夸其谈，却缺乏知识和见地去阐述一个他们自己并不能理解的真理。当然也有这种人，他们心里有很多真理也知道这些真理的含义，正因为如此，才不用把它们付诸于言语。     当你在路边或市场遇见你的朋友时，让你内心的思想控制你的嘴唇，指挥你的舌头。用你内心的声音说给他的耳朵听。 因为他的灵魂会记住你内心的真话，正如美酒的味道会被记住而颜色却会被淡忘一样。
