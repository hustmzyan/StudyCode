  Partricia Pania never wanted to be a national public figure. All she wanted to be was a mother and a homemaker. But her life was turned upside down when a motorist district by his cell phone, ran a stop sign and crashed into the side of her car. The impact killed her two-year-old daughter.     Four months later, Partricia reluctantly but courageously decided to try to educate the public and to fight for laws to ban drivers from using cell phones while a car is moving. She wanted to save other children from what happened to her daughter. In her first speech, Partricia got off to a shaky start. She was visibly trembling and her voice was soft and uncertain. But as she got into her speech, a dramatic transtormation took place. She stopped shaking and spoke with a strong voice. For the rest of her talk, she was a forceful and compelling speaker.She wanted everyone in the audience to know what she knew without having to learn it from a personal tragedy. Many in the audience were moved to tears, and to action.     In subsequent presentations, Pania gained reputation as a highly effective speaker. Her appearance on a talk show was broadcast three times transmitting her messageto over 14,000,000 people. Her campaign increased public awareness of the problem and prompted over 300 cities and several states to consider restrictions on cell phone use.
