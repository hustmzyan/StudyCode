Do any of these come close to your own knowledge, your personal experience of whom you really are?   In your quiet moments, in times of inexplicable joy, have you had the overwhelming and yet clear and lucid feeling of total invincibility -- a feeling that nothing can hold you down, that you can accomplish anything and everything if you put your mind to it? Well, that feeling is not a random one.   What is ti that gets in the way of your exquisite power?   In fact, the infinite power that is naturally present in each and every one of us by virtue of own consicousness, can be rendered ineffectived if not tended to properly.

Choose natural, organic products.   Live a life of kindness, compassion, and charity -- it keeps you connected to your center, your source, that infinite reservoir within you that is your powerhouse.   Don't judge people, or situation -- approach each moment with the potential of any number of possibilities.   To connect with your real nature that is unbounded and invincible, practice yoga and mediation   Once you are in touch with your true nature, then nothing is beyond your means-- you are truly empowered. And that is an accurate definition of you!
