  "So you never knew whether it was a boy or ...? "     "A girl?" asked Malcolm.     I nodded.     "A boy," he said. "Had the approximate date and went to the Registry of Births to look it up."     I sat there, trying to take in what Malcom had said. I felt as though I'd been flattened by a truck.     "Somewhere out there I have a child I know nothing about," Malcom continued. "I was stupid. Rushed off instead of staying to have a share in my son's life."     "I thought perhaps it was a daughter."     "Beg your pardon?"     "A daughter. Me."     "You thought I was ... your father?"     "Books, curry, I'm tall. We ... we like the same things."     "We definitely have things in common but I'm not your father." He looked at me.     "I'm so sorry to disappoint you, Leanna." I tried to smile.     "We're not related but we can be something else."     "What?"     "Can't you think of anything?"     "Uh uh."     "Friends."     "Friends?"     "It's been staring you in the face for weeks." Malcolm's use of that phrase made me burst out laughing.     "Let me in on the joke sometime," he said.     "Okay," I said. "Tell you sometime seeing we're friends."     Then I smiled. And my smile was as wide and warm as the one he smiled in return
