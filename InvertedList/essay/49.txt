  1. Leave your cars at home     Cars, being the greatest source of air pollution, can be left at home this weekend. Travelling via public transport is the better option. Other greener options are carpooling, riding a bike or you can also walk if you want a healthier option and if your workplace is not that far away from your home.      2. Be a little dirty     No, we don't mean it 'that' way. We simply mean to say, don't take a bath. Yes, conservation of water is super essential. A day or two without a bath won't harm you, but it will certainly do a lot of good for our planet. A daily shower isn't a matter of health; it's a matter of comfort. Showering every day can wash away the natural oils that our skin and hair need.      3. Volunteer yourself     This is one of the best things you can do. Why? Because it will do you good too. Join other like-minded individuals in a common task. If you have the time, there are lots of opportunities out there to pitch in, for instance, planting trees, cleaning a park or simply coming up with ways you can preserve mother Earth.      4. Green-up your home     This is one of the most common things that people do whenever Earth Day rolls around, that is, switch off their lights. However, this is not something you should do just for a day and for only an hour. Conserve energy by switching of all power and/or electricity points whenever they are not in use. In addition, take out all the plugs from plug points even after switching them off.      5. Pledge to do more everyday     You know what the best way to celebrate Earth Day is? Extend your celebrations. That's right! Do something everyday that will improve your surroundings to make the planet a better place to live in. Always remember that every step, every initiative counts.      The future of our planet is in your hands!
