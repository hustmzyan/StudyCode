  It sometimes seems that intense desire creates not only its own opportunities, but its own talents.     We feel free when we escape - even if it be but from the frying pan to the fire.     There would be no society if living together depended upon understanding each other.     The only way to predict the future is to have the power to shape the future.     No matter what our achievements might be, we think well of ourselves only in rare moments. We need people to bear witness against our inner judge, who keeps look on our shortcomings and transgression. We need people to convince us that we are not as bad as we think we are.     You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you.     The leader has to be practical and a realist, yet must talk the language of visionary and idealist.     In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.     We do not really feel grateful toward those who make our dreams come true; they ruin our dreams.     We need our own dreams.
