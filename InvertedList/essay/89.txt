 I've learned that sometimes all a person need is a hand to hold and a heart to understand.   I've learned that the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think I can?   I've learned that love, not time, heals all wounds.   I've learned that every one you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.   I've learned that there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling their breath on your cheeks.   I've learned that on one is perfect until you fall in love with them.   I've learned that opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.   I've learned that when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.   I've learned that I wish I could have told my Mom that I love her one more time before she passed away.   I've learned that one should keep his words both soft and tender, because tomorrow he may have ti eat them.   I've learned that a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.     I've learned that I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.   I've learned that everyone wants to stand on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it.   I've learned that it is best to give advice in only two circumstances :when it is requested and when it is a life-threatening situation.   I've learned that the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.
