 Today I saw a butterfly,   as it floated in the air;   Its wings were spread in splendor,   Unaware that I was there.   It was such a thing of beauty,   It was a sight to see;   It was the perfect masterpiece,   Full of grace and majesty.   I found myself thinking,   to what can this compare?   And then, of course, I thought of you,   And I wished that you were there.   God sure was extra careful,   When He formed and fashioned you;   You too, became a masterpiece,   Yet God is still not through.   He's daily making changes,   that other folks can't see;   You're already true perfection,   At least you are to me.
